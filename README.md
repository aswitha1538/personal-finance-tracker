# Personal Finance Tracker

Hey there! Welcome to my Personal Finance Tracker—a little project I put together to help manage my money, and hopefully, it can help you too! It’s a web app with a React frontend and a Flask backend, packed with features to track your income, expenses, and savings. I’ve added a bar chart to visualize spending, a theme switcher for day/night modes, and even currency conversion for those international vibes. Let’s get you set up to start tracking your finances!

## What It Does
- **Track Finances**: Add your income and expenses with categories like Food, Entertainment, Bills, and more.
- **Visualize Spending**: A bar chart shows how your money is split across categories—super handy for spotting trends!
- **Set Savings Goals**: Enter a savings goal and see your progress as a percentage (no more "Infinity%"—I fixed that!).
- **Switch Themes**: Toggle between day and night modes with a sun/moon button for a comfy viewing experience.
- **Currency Conversion**: Switch between currencies like USD, EUR, INR, and more to see your finances in your preferred currency.
- **Manage Transactions**: View your recent transactions and delete them if needed.
